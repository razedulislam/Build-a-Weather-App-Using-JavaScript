2. The use of Fetch API
3. The navigator object of JavaScript
4. How to use a third-party API service and more

Getting Data from API
The first thing to understand is how do we get the weather data? To get the data, we are dependent on a third-party service. We will use a website called OpenWeatherMap. OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides various weather data through API. We can integrate the API into our app and can use the data on our website. An API is like a waiter, it works as a medium between the server and the client to serve the data to the client according to the client's request.

OpenWeatherMap is free up to a certain number of requests.

#We need an API key to use this api. 
Step 1: Open OpenWeatherMap and click on Sign In:
Step 2: Click on "Not Registered? Create an account", if you don't have an account,
Step 3: Fill out the form and click on sign up to create your account.
Step 4: Click on API on the menu
Step 5: Because we need the current weather data, we will need to subscribe to the Current Weather Data API subscription. It is the first option you will see in the menu. Click on Subscribe.
Step 6: Now, the pricings window will open. We don't need any paid plan for this hobby project. So, select the free option here, and we are almost done.
Step 7: After subscribing to it, in the top right corner, where your profile name appears, click on it, and select My API Keys
Step 8: You will find your API key here. Keep it safe, and do not share it publicly with anyone.
